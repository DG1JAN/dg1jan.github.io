<h2>USB-C Power Delivery for hamradios</h2>

Powering qrp tranceiver or charging HTs on the go has become quite easey with USB-C.<br>
<br>
USB-C Power Delivery (PD) is a fast charging standard that allows for higher power 
transmission over USB-C connections and cables. Unlike older USB standards, which were 
typically limited to 2.5 to 15 watts, USB-C PD can support much higher power levels, 
up to 100 watts. This makes it suitable for a wider range of devices, including smartphones, 
tablets, laptops, and even ham radio equipment :-)<br>
<br>
To signalize the USB Charger (or Power Bank) which Voltage the internal DC/DC converter should 
delivere, a "PD-Trigger" circuit is required.<br>
<br>
The common voltage levels provided by USB-C PD are: 5V, 9V,12V,15V and 20V<br>
<br>
I've been using a 12V PD-Triger circuit (sourced from Amazon) now for almost one year to charge my 
Yaesu FT-70D during biz-tripps. So I can let the bulky Yaesu charger at home and use my USB-C phone 
charger also for the HT.<br>
<br>
Now I've build two additional adapters to e.g. supply my QDX tranceiver- <br>
I will try this minimal FT8 setup on my next trip.<br>
