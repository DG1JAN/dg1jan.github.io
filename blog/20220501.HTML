<h2>CQ COTA - CQ Burgentag 2022</h2>
<hr style="height:1px;border-width:0;color:#FFBF00; background-color: #FFBF00;">
<p style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre;"></p>
1th of Mai is reserved for COTA (Castles On The Air). The German COAT group <br>
(https://www.cotagroup.org/cotagroup/) is organizing the "Deutscher Burgentag"<br>
(German Castle-Day) as an activation day for COTA/WCA.<br>
<br>
So I ask Dominik (DO1DOS) to join for a (first time) activation of the "Burgruine<br>
Freudenburg" (Referenz: DL-01050).Beside the smooth activation, we got a very nice surprise as Gerardo (PH1DLB) was <br>
visiting the castle with his family on a vacation trip. He (and we as well) was kind of <br>
overwhelmed meeting unexpected two other hams at this location ;-)<br>
<br>
As we had some time left and the weather was really nice, we decide to change the <br>
location to Saarburg and do a second (double) activation of "Saarburg" (DL-01053) and<br>
"Schloss Warsberg" (DL-01054)<br>
