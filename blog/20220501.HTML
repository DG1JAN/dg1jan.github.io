<h2>CQ COTA - CQ Burgentag 2022</h2>

<p style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre;"></p>
1th of Mai is reserved for COTA (Castles On The Air). The German COAT group
(https://www.cotagroup.org/cotagroup/) is organizing the "Deutscher Burgentag"
(German Castle-Day) as an activation day for COTA/WCA.

So I ask Dominik (DO1DOS) to join for a (first time) activation of the "Burgruine
Freudenburg" (Referenz: DL-01050).Beside the smooth activation, we got a very nice surprise as Gerardo (PH1DLB) was vis-
iting the castle with his family on a vacation trip. He (and we as well) was kind of over-
whelmed meeting unexpected two other hams at this location ;-)

As we had some time left and the weather was really nice, we decide to change the loca-
tion to Saarburg and do a second (double) activation of "Saarburg" (DL-01053) and
"Schloss Warsberg" (DL-01054)
